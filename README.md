# Mini C Programs

This is a small repository of my own C code snippets. I have made folders to each code to organize them neatly. Each folder contains a **README** file. Read that file and get an idea of what that program is intended to do.

> NOTE: Try to find a solution for yourselves before seeing the source code.
