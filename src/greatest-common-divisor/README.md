1. Take two integers from the user.
2. Find the greatest common divisor (aka GCD) of those two numbers and print it.

## Bonus Tasks

- Take an array of numbers from the user and calculate the GCD of those. (_Hint:_ Try implementing the 'recursion' method of Euclid to find GCD of multiple numbers. Wikipedia has the explanation w/ example.)
